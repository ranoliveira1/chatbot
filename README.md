# chatbot
This is a project of a Chat Bot to guide new students in an University.
It is drawn to try to figure out what the user whant to know, analysing key words within the ask made by the user.
Once the user confirms that the chatbot understood what they want to ask, the words within the question made by the user is stored in a json file. It helps the chatbot to improve itself.
